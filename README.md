# Analyzing the Fast Food Chain A/B test results
This project is inspired from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test">Kaggle dataset</a> on Fast Food A/B testing.

## Context
In this experiment, a marketing campaign was tested to see which promotion would drive the most sales to the new item on the menu. Three promotions were tested at locations in several randomly selected markets.

## Goal
The task is to determine which promotion should be used by the fast food chain. Specifically, the goal is to maximize the following metric:

<ul>
<li><code>SalesInThousands</code> - how much sales were generated for the new item on a weekly basis.</li>
</ul>

## Questions
<ol>
<li>Analyze the results of the marketing campaign by observing the sales by promotion type</li>
<li>Bootstraping and ANOVA tests to prove statistical significance</li>
</ol>
